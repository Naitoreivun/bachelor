# bachelor

The code is wrapped in Celero benchmark tool. Path to code:
`celero/experiments/BachelorAlgorithmsBenchmark`

In order to build and run the benchmark test:
1. Open terminal in root directory (that consists `tests` and `celero` directories)
2. type `mkdir build && cd build`
3. type `cmake ..` to build makefile
4. type `make install` to build program
5. type `./celeroBachelorAlgorithmsBenchmark` to run benchmark (it can last even few hours)
